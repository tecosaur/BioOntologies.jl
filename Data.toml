Human Phenotype Ontology

The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) project provides an ontology of medically
relevant phenotypes, disease-phenotype annotations, and the algorithms that
operate on these. The HPO can be used to support differential diagnostics,
translational research, and a number of applications in computational biology
by providing the means to compute over the clinical phenotype. The HPO is being
used for computational deep phenotyping and precision medicine as well as
integration of clinical data into translational research. Deep phenotyping can
be defined as the precise and comprehensive analysis of phenotypic
abnormalities in which the individual components of the phenotype are observed
and described. The HPO is being increasingly adopted as a standard for
phenotypic abnormalities by diverse groups such as international rare disease
organizations, registries, clinical labs, biomedical resources, and clinical
software tools and will thereby contribute toward nascent efforts at global
data exchange for identifying disease etiologies (KÃ¶hler et al, 2017).

The HPO currently contains over 13,000 terms arranged in a directed acyclic
graph and are connected by is-a (subclass-of) edges, such that a term represents
a more specific or limited instance of its parent term(s). All relationships in
the HPO are is-a relationships, i.e. simple class-subclass relationships. For
instance, Abnormal lens morphology is-a Abnormal eye morphology. The
relationships are transitive, meaning that they are inherited up all paths to
the root. Phenotypic abnormality is the main subontology of the HPO and contains
descriptions of clinical abnormalities. Additional subontologies are provided to
describe inheritance patterns, onset/clinical course and modifiers of
abnormalities."""
